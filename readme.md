JS13K Boilerplate
=================

Boilerplate for creating JS13K games. Using [rollup](https://rollupjs.org/), [uglify-es](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uglify-es) (for minifying es2015) and a few scripts of my own for [creating music](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hum-drum) and animating SVG.

Use `npm start` for development, `npm run zip` to zip into a _dist.zip_ file.
